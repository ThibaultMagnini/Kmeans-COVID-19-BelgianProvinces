# Kmeans-COVID-19-BelgianProvinces

Jonas and I are currently researching provincial relations in Belgium during the COVID-19 Pandemic.
This research is in collaboration with *Sao Paulo State University- The Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP)*

Given the Governement Dataset we are looking for the correct parameters to cluster the different belgian provinces.
This way we can find in what regions COVID-19 has had a bigger impact. 
And provide insights on what regions are more vunreable and need more guidance/help.

Some of the results/graphs can be found in /Results .
These are some intermediate results which are current applications of our clustering algorithm.

## K means clustering algoritm

This research is based on the Kmeans clustering algorithm.
